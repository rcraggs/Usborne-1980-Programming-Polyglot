# Usborne-1980-Programming-Polyglot
Code from 1980s programming books, rewritten in many modern languages.

Usrborne have opened up their (programming books from the 1980s)[http://www.usborne.com/catalogue/feature-page/computer-and-coding-books.aspx]. These contain full applications written in BASIC for people to type into their computer.

This repo is for people to rewrite those old programs in different programming languages:

## Contributing:

- Feel free to add more of the Usborne books as the top level directory
- Feel free to add more sub-directories for different programming languages
- Create different versions for different languages eg trying a line by line rewrite or a more idiomatic approach.
